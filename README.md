# Weather_Predictor

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the weather of Seattle using its historical weather data. By leveraging the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we aim to forecast future weather conditions based on past trends. The repository includes the model, the dataset used, visualizations of the historical data, and future weather predictions. The outputs are also visualized through graphs for better interpretation.

The project is structured to guide anyone who is interested in time series forecasting using LSTM, particularly for weather prediction. By analyzing historical weather data and training the LSTM model, this project provides an accurate and insightful prediction of Seattle's weather over the upcoming days.

Features
Historical Weather Data Analysis: Preprocessing and visualizing Seattle's past weather trends to understand patterns.
LSTM Model for Prediction: Training an LSTM neural network to predict future weather patterns based on historical data.
Graphical Representation: The project provides visual insights in the form of graphs that depict the predicted weather trends.
Future Weather Forecasting: Using the trained LSTM model, predictions of future weather for the Seattle area are generated and shared.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical weather data from Seattle, sourced from publicly available weather databases. It includes daily records such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant parameters. The data was preprocessed to remove noise and handle missing values before being fed into the LSTM model.

The dataset used in this project can be found in this repository.

LSTM Model
The core of this project lies in the implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for time series forecasting because of its ability to learn from long sequences of past data without losing relevant information. Hereâ€™s an outline of the model:

Data Preprocessing: The historical data is normalized and structured into sequences that the LSTM model can understand.
LSTM Architecture: The model consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by Dense layers to predict the weather parameters.
Training: The model is trained using the historical weather data, and its performance is evaluated using validation datasets.
Prediction: Once trained, the model predicts future weather conditions based on the patterns it has learned.
Graphical Representation
To make the results more accessible, the project includes visualizations of both the historical and predicted weather data. The graphs are generated using popular Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. They provide insights into the trends captured by the model and the predicted weather conditions for the upcoming days.

The graphs include:

Temperature trends: A comparison of actual and predicted temperature values.
Humidity trends: Forecasted humidity based on historical data.
Other weather parameters: Wind speed, precipitation, etc., depending on the available dataset.


Results
The LSTM model is able to predict future weather patterns with reasonable accuracy. The predictions are not perfect, as weather forecasting can be influenced by many external factors not captured in the historical data, but the model captures the overall trends and provides valuable insights into future weather conditions.

Future Improvements
While this model performs well, there are several areas where it can be improved:

Data Augmentation: Incorporating more features such as pressure, cloud cover, and air quality.
Model Tuning: Experimenting with different LSTM architectures and hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
Real-time Forecasting: Connecting the model with real-time weather APIs for live predictions.
